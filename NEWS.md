# BrainGnomes 0.8-2

* Refactor postprocessing to use job arrays and sentinels for cleanup
* Add additional templates to prefetch needed by MRIQC

# BrainGnomes 0.8-1

Released 2026-03-10

* Improve CLI interface to support --help or BrainGnomes <command> help
* Add CLI status command to get project status from command line
* Add dry_run option to run_project to see what would be run without executing it
* Refactor prefetch to accept cohort specifications and extend them to T2w fetch.
* Refactor prefetch to fall back to no desc field if desc:brain fails
* Expand fMRIPrep TemplateFlow defaults to include MNI152NLin2009cAsym boldref, res-2 brain mask, brain probseg, and carpet dseg assets observed during workflow construction
* Add conditional CIFTI TemplateFlow defaults so prefetch only stages MNI152NLin6Asym and fsLR sphere assets when fMRIPrep CLI options request `--cifti-output`
* Harden prefetch caching and validation checks so that later failures invalidate skip logic
* Make prefetch state query-specific so that an exact snapshot of templateflow files is retained
* Move prefetch state files out of `templateflow_home` and into hashed project log paths; legacy state files in `templateflow_home` are now migrated and removed to avoid poisoning TemplateFlow standard-space discovery.
* Expand TemplateFlow default to desc=None for T1w to mirror some versions of fmriprep.
* Harden check on flywheel location to accommodate missing fw command.
* Update RSQLite connections to default to `synchronous=NULL` to prevent spurious warnings
* Included OASIS30 as a default template space for prefetch because it is used by fmriprep
* bugfix: preserve `cohort-<n>` in BIDS parsing/reconstruction so postprocessing can resolve cohort-qualified fMRIPrep outputs such as `space-MNIPediatricAsym_cohort-2`

# BrainGnomes 0.8

Released 2026-02-17

* Add optional low-pass filtering of motion parameters before FD recomputation; rename notch config fields to
  `bandstop_min_bpm`/`bandstop_max_bpm` (deprecated: `band_stop_min`/`band_stop_max`).
* All HPC jobs are now tracked in detail by an SQLite database
* Job failures and other errors can now be investigated using `diagnose_pipeline`
* Added a new vignette, "Diagnosing Pipeline Runs", that walks through `get_project_status()`, `get_subject_status()`,
  and interactive use of `diagnose_pipeline()`
* Improved error logging in HPC scripts so that success and failure are indicated more clearly
* Stale .fail files are removed when a newer .complete file exists, clarifying status of processing steps
* Jobs now write a manifest of files and times to the job tracking database for more thorough completeness tests
* Added optional low-pass filtering of motion parameters, matching Gratton
* Gracefully adjust motion filtering parameters if they fall above Nyquist at this TR
* Modify extract ROIs config to avoid input_regex and always generate it internally from postproc stream
* Add optional header row for postprocessed confounds TSVs, configurable via postprocess YAML and validated during setup
* Added extensive checks on write/permission issues with directories and files
* bugfix: Get CSF probseg image for MRIQC during prefetch
* `run_project()` now skips TemplateFlow prefetch only when a prior successful prefetch covers requested spaces and the TemplateFlow manifest in job tracking still verifies; missing/deleted template files trigger re-prefetch.
* bugfix: preserve user-specified `metadata/log_directory` (including external paths) instead of always resetting to `<project_directory>/logs`.
* During postprocess setup, `confound_calculate` now offers guided prompts to add `framewise_displacement` when omitted, including whether to use motion-filtered FD and whether FD should be processed vs kept as `noproc` for QC/exclusion workflows.
* Increase consistency of instructions and formatting in `setup_project()`
* bugfix: avoid spurious "Already disconnected" warnings on exit from `diagnose_pipeline()`
* bugfix: `diagnose_pipeline()` now respects configured `metadata/log_directory` instead of assuming `<project_directory>/logs`
* bugfix: `diagnose_pipeline()` now matches subjects by exact `sub-<id>` tokens to avoid accidental partial matches
* bugfix: `run_bg_and_wait()` now suppresses and restores `ERR` trap handling around `wait`, so non-zero container exits can be reconciled against success tokens before jobs are marked failed.
* bugfix: shell trap handlers now attempt a best-effort SQLite status update to `FAILED` before exit, reducing `_fail`/DB mismatch after abrupt failures.
* bugfix: `update_tracked_job_status()` now warns when no tracking rows are updated for a job_id (instead of failing silently).
* bugfix: `check_status_reconciliation()` now checks `.fail` markers against DB status and reports mismatch details.

# BrainGnomes 0.7-5

Released 2026-01-13

* Add `calculate_motion_outliers` function to calculate motion outliers in a BIDS dataset
  - Returns mean FD alongside max FD
  - Includes task and run columns from BIDS info
  - Supports optional `output_file` argument to write results (CSV or TSV, with gzip support)
  - Defaults for notch filter: `bandstop_min_bpm = 12`, `bandstop_max_bpm = 18` BPM
* Use the `scratch_directory` for postprocessing images to avoid collisions and ensure that intermediates do not clog the output folder
* Check that python packages directory is writable prior to attempting to resample a stereotaxic template to an image; fall back to
    a managed `reticulate` environment if not.
* More robust postprocess logging (fallback log directory if requested location is unavailable) and clearer reporting of retained
    volumes during confound regression.
* bugfix: 0 values for temporal filter cutoffs now disable the corresponding low/high-pass filter components.
* bugfix: more complete handling of cases where confound calculate/regress is enabled, but no columns are specified.
* bugfix: ROI extraction now writes empty connectivity outputs (with warnings) when all ROIs are dropped after filtering.
* bugfix: add T2w to template pre-fetch so that fmriprep does not try to obtain this when users have T2w images
* bugfix: correct regex in postprocessing step substitution when using user-specified order
* bugfix: prevent spurious failure files for fMRIPrep/AROMA jobs that return non-zero exit codes despite successful completion

# BrainGnomes 0.7-3

Released 2025-11-11

* bugfix: correctly handle unsigned integer data types in NIfTIs
* lmfit_residuals_4d now handles partial (ala fsl_regfilt) and full regression and is used for applying AROMA

* fsl_regfilt.R wrapper script removed from pipeline -- all regression now happens with lmfit_residuals_4d
* bugfix: args_to_df now tolerate multiple arguments after a hyphen
* Added pre-fetch step for TemplateFlow files so that network access can be turned off inside singularity containers,
    avoiding socket errors that crop up within python's multiprocessing module.
* Amended PBS scripts to match current pipeline
* TemplateFlow prefetch now runs via dedicated Slurm/PBS scripts that mirror other steps, including trapping and logging
* bugfix: confound regression does not crash when scrubbing is disabled
* bugfix: incorporate additional BIDS entities into location of confounds file

  robust file handling, and optional AROMA cleanup with safety checks for MNI res-2 outputs.
* Refined project setup and validation by verifying directories before saving,
  prompting for required containers, and allowing projects to run without a postprocessing directory.
* Documentation and test improvements, including an expanded quickstart guide and instructions for building the FSL container.
